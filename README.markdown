Memflash
========

Memflash is a gem which enables storing really long values in the Rails FlashHash
without writing them to the session. Instead, it transparently uses `Rails.cache`, thus
enabling the flash in your actions to contain large values, and still fit in a cookie-based
session store.

How do I use it?
================

Memflash is completely transparent -- requiring the gem automatically enhances FlashHash
with caching-enabled reads and writes.

By default, any message that is over 300 characters long, will be saved in Rails.cache,
and a pointer to it stored in the flash. You can change this anywhere in your app by:

    Memflash.threshold = #{length-at-which-writing-to-the-cache-is-trigerred}

How does it work?
=================

Memflash ties into the [] and []= methods of Rails's FlashHash. On writes, if the value
being written has a length over Memflash.threshold, Memflash generates a pseudo-random
key for it, writes the pseudo-random key and original value to `Rails.cache`, and stores
the original key and pseudo-random key in the flash. Conceptually, when you write
`flash[:error] = "some message"`, this is equivalent to:

    if "some message".length >=  Memflash.threshold
      # generate a psedudo-random key, memflash_key
      # write memflash_key, "some message" to Rails.cache
      # write :error, memflash_key to the flash
    else
      # write :error, "some message" to the flash, as usual
    end

On the flip side, reading from the flash, `flash[:error]` is conceptually equivalent to:

    if the value for :error stored in the flash is a memflash key
      # read the original (large) value from Rails.cache
      # return the original (large) value
    else
      # return the value stored in the flash, as usual
    end

TODO
====
 - replace jeweler with bundler

Anything else?
==============

We'd love to hear from you!
